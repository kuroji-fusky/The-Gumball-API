# The Gumball API

> **Note**
> Project still under construction, not production-ready yet!

The Gumball API is an open source REST and GraphQL API based from the
show "The Amazing World of Gumball".

## Technology stack

The Gumball API is written entirely in Python with the FastAPI web
framework.

Hosting the actual API is currently out of my budget at this point of time; but if I
we're to host it at some point - it would be the help from Supabase and Cloudflare
caching.
