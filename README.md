# Wattersons API

The Gumball/Wattersons API is an open-source REST and GraphQL API for 
The Amazing World of Gumball.



# Technology stack

The Gumball/Wattersons is written entirely in Python with the FastAPI web
framework.

Hosting the actual API is out of my budget at this point of time; but if I
we're to host it at some point - it would be the help from Supabase and 
Cloudflare caching
